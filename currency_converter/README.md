# Currency Converter
This program is intended to convert the currencies USD, Euro, Pound, and Yen to one another given the users choice and preffered amount.
The currency rates are outdated and not accurate.

## Code to be Improved
Add a statement after each user currency input that only accepts integers. If a letter is entered loop back around.
Take user currency input and re-display it in proper format.
Add more currency options
Is it possible to have the currency conversion rates updated real-time?

### Purpose of this Project
The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to work with functions, do-while loops, switch statements, and basic 
understanding of the c++ programming language.
